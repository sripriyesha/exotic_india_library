Preface
Unlike other aspects of society, Samskara is treated as a means of reform in both society and human life. With the introduction of Samskara, one becomes equipped to deal with necessary occasion. Due to Samskara unnecessary elements are eradicated and necessary elements are taken into account. In this regard Upanayana is identified as a vital Samskara on account of which one becomes eligible to go under celibacy for achieving education. Education is understood as a secular Samskara, because each and every person needs education for achievement of one's goal in life. Since Upanayana Samskara is of greater importance, it is celebrated with much care. More scriptural injunctions and procedures are not enough; customs of locality, family as well as community are of much importance to be ob-served here. In this small piece of work an attempt has been made to acquint the readers regarding Upanayana. However, in each and every point, we have tried to expose the sastric support of customs in an analytical manner. Readers would be benefited with the basic sources of various points linked with Upanayana Samskara appended in this work. Not only in India or in Hindu community, but in each country and community we find this sacrament called initiation regarding which a huge amount of description is given here to show the resemblance of Upanayana Samskara. 
In preparing this work, I have received much help and assistance from my student Dr. Anjali Dei, Head of Depart-ment of Sanskrit, Niali College, Niali, Cuttack, Orissa. I express my heartfelt thanks to her. I also extend my sincere gratitued to M/s Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan, Varanasi for whose effort this work has seen the light of the day. In the long run I bow down my head before the lotus feet of Lord Jagannatha for smooth completion of this endeavour, Dharmo raksati raksitah.

Gandhari’s curse has come true. Near the confluence of the Saraswati, Kapila and Hiranya rivers, Krishna lies under an Aswattha tree, fatally wounded by Jara’s arrow. In his final moments, he reminisces about his time in the mortal world, and the women in his life appear before him. The self-assured, erudite royal consort Rukmini, the most precious of his 16,008 wives, asks him why he is embarking upon moksha alone when she was a fellow traveller on his journeys through dharma, artha and kama. Satyabhama, who came into his life carrying the Syamantak diamond in her trousseau, and dazzled him with her beauty and charm, grapples with the meaning of their marriage. Draupadi, his friend and confidante, is eager to know if Krishna ever desired her romantically. And Radha, one with Krishna in heart and soul, although she is another man’s wife, prepares again to free him of all ties, like she did when he had left Gokul.
